        When given a system that has been normalized by spglib, this function
        will find a atomic positions within that cell that are most unique
        (totally unique up to isotropic scaling if no free Wyckoff parameters
        present).

        The function is based on finding a "normalizer" (found for each space
        group e.g. at the Bilbao Crystallographic Server)
        http://www.cryst.ehu.es/), which is essentially a transform that
        changes Wyckoff positions of atoms within a cell without breaking the
        symmetry. Each of these normalizers, that corresponds to a proper rigid
        transformation in the cartesian basis, is applied to give a different
        structural representation. The algorithm then goes through each tuple
        of Wyckoff letter and atomic number (W , Z) in a preset order: the
        first loop goes through the Wyckoff letters in alphabetical order, and
        the second loop goes through the atomic numbers from lowest to highest.
        Whenever some of the possible representations has a structural
        component corresponding to the current tuple (W , Z), the number of
        atoms with this tuple N is calculated. The representation is stored to
        a map structure that links each N to a list of representations and the
        highest N is tracked. After all the representations are covered, the
        candidate list of representations is replaced with the list
        corresponding to the highest N. The algorithm stops whenever the
        candidate set contains only one representation, which will be the
        standard one.

        Args:
            space_group(int): The space group of the system.
            old_wyckoff_letters(list of strings): Wyckoff letters as detected
                by spglib for the atoms in the given system.
            system(ase.Atoms): The standardized system as given by spglib.
            is_flat(bool): Whether the structure is flat (near zero thickness)
                in one non-periodic direction. Applies only for 2D systems.
            nonperiodic_axis(int): The index of a nonperiodic axis in the cell
                basis. Applies only for 2D systems.

        Returns:
            (ase.Atoms, list of strings): Returns a tuple containing the found
            conventional system and the Wyckoff letters for it.
